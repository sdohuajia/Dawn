   python run.py
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The recommended delay between keepalive requests is 120 seconds.
- If you have unverified accounts, you can use the `register` module again to reverify them.
- Captcha solving now uses external services (2captcha, anti-captcha) due to changes in captcha complexity.
- A database is used to optimize login processes by storing authorization tokens.
- For email services like Gmail, you may need to use application-specific passwords instead of regular email passwords.

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Email Verification Issues**: Check your email provider's IMAP settings in `settings.yaml`.
- **Captcha Problems**: Verify your captcha service API key and account balance.
- **Proxy Issues**: Ensure your proxy format is correct and the proxies are functional.
